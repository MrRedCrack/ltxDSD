\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, a smart traffic light control system implementation that adapts and optimizes traffic according to car detection sensor signals has been fully developed and tested using SystemVerilog \ac{hdl}, which is ready to be synthesized and programmed into a \ac{fpga}. It is a fair traffic control system that is not biased to any particular road but adapts better sequence timings when one road is detected to be less busy than another. However, the parameters in the system source code can be quickly reconfigured to customize any timing components, which makes the controller module highly reusable for different biasing or general timing requirements.
